  "scripts": {
    "serve": "vue-cli-service serve",
    "build": "vue-cli-service build"
  }
}

You can invoke these scripts using either npm or Yarn:
npm run serve
yarn serve
-----------------------------------

If you have npx available (should be bundled with an up-to-date version of npm), you
can also invoke the binary directly with:

npx vue-cli-service serve
